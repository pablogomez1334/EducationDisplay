# EducationDisplay

The analysis involves visualizing education levels of different countries, specifically comparing Afghanistan and Aruba. The data is read in from two separate datasets, electricity.csv and secondary_edu.csv, and cleaned using dplyr functions, including removing irrelevant variables, renaming columns, and pivoting data from wide to long format using pivot_longer. The cleaned datasets are then merged using left_join based on country names, country codes, and years. The resulting dataset is used to create a line plot using ggplot2, with lines and points representing education levels over time. The plot includes legends for country differentiation and is filtered to display relevant years of data. The analysis aims to provide a visual comparison of education levels between Afghanistan and Aruba using the created plot.
